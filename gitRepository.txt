1. Git Repository :
Git repo contains files, history and config managed by git.

 Q. How to create git repo ?
    -> to create the git repo first we need to have one folder.
    -> then we have to run "git inti" in that folder that command create the ".git" folder where our history and configuration are saved.
    -> ".git" is hidden folder so we don't delete this folder by mistake.

2. Remote Repository : 
A code hosting server, for example "github".

3. Stages in Git :
	
	-> there are 3 stages.
		
		-> Working Area (Untracked Area): Working area is where we are "Coding Live". and git can't track our file here. and no history maintained by git.
			Q. How can we go from "working area" to "staging area" ?
			  -> Use "git add <file_name>" to take files from "working area" to "staging area".
			  -> And also use "git commit -m 'text message'" which help us to tell other what changes we made.

		-> Staging Area (Tracked Area): Stage area is where git start to tracking the file "which file is changed", "by who", "when it's happed" all the details save by git.
			Q. how the take our file to " staging area" to "git repo" OR get the file from "git repo"?
			  -> Use "git push" to add all the files from "staging area" to "git repo". 
			  -> Use "git pull" to get all the files from "git repo" to "staging area".
		-> Github Repo (Central Server): the online server that store our files. Example : github.

Q. how to set username & email ?
   -> to set username : Use 'git config --global user.name "USER_NAME" '.
   -> to set user email: Use 'get config --global user.email "USER_EMAIL" '.

-> Use "git status" to see the status of "staging area".
-> if you want to any spacific file to add use "git add 'FILE_NAME'" OR you want to add more then one file use "git add . ".
-> Now files area added to "staging area" use "git status" one more time to check added files.
-> so, files are added into "staging area". use "git commit -m 'text message'" to commit your changes.
-> so, use "git log" to see the details about commit( who did which commit) and use "git log --oneline" to see the details in one line example: af93ae0 (HEAD -> master) adding sample-1.txt and sample-2.txt file
